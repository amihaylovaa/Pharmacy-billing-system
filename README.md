# Pharmacy billing system

 This is a console application which simulates purchases in a pharmacy.
 
Both the pharmacist and the customer must have an account in the system in order to use the functionality.

In order to make a purchase :
1) Authenticate the pharmacist
2) If he/she is not found, an account should be created and then go to 1) 
3) The pharmacist has the choice to: 
- add a product 
- make a purchase 
- add a new customer, if he/she is not authenticated

The data for the people(pharmacist and customer), products, city, street etc. is stored in relational database - MySQL.
